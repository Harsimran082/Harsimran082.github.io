#### **1.The Eternal Friendship** 
![The eternal friendship](https://i.ibb.co/HXCCtsV/eternal-friendship.jpg)
> I saw my friend with the coach
>  
> Asking about to join his friend
>  
> I knew that the seats were full
> 
> So why was he here........



> My eyes became full of tears
> 
> When I listened through my ears.
> 
> I clicked the picture in my eyes
> 
> And saved them into my life.

> When he returned, I asked,
> 
> "Oh my friend! Where were you?"
> 
> "Don't you know where I was?
> 
> Okay. I had gone to bring a glass
> 
> And brought a news which is first class."

> "What! What! Tell my friend
> 
> I am waiting for a new trend"
> 
> "You are joined in the cricket club
> 
>  Now let's enjoy n go to pub"

> "Only to pub you tell
> 
>  Let's go to temple as well"
>  
> "You are now out of trouble
> 
>  Lets enjoy this moment double"

> "This is the proof of true friendship
> 
> Oh Lord! Never this to lend it.
> 
> Keep this friendship till the doom
> 
> Everyone will remember, there was once in a Blue Moon."
